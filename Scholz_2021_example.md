Taken from Scholz, S.F. (2021) _Investigating the influence of socio-environmental cues of harshness on delay discounting behavior utilizing virtual reality._

# VR setting
VR scenes resembling one deprived neighborhood and one affluent neighborhood were used, creating an immersive experience for the participant. The Oculus Rift S PC-Powered VR Gaming-headset was used for the VR scenes, which comes with two controllers. The software of oculus must be downloaded as an App and is called Oculus Rift Software. The two respective VR scenes were created and played on the cross-platform game engine called Unity 2.3 2020.

The layout of both VR scenes was very similar see (Appendices B & C). Both scenes had a basketball court in the center of the map, surrounded by a Sidewalk. The court and the sidewalk were surrounded by a street that separated the center from the residential buildings. The infrastructure and type of buildings suggest that the VR neighborhood scenes resemble western countries. Between some of the houses are alleyways, in which simulations of characters were placed.

The VR scene of the experimental condition called deprived neighborhood illustrating socio-environmental cues of harshness was characterized by features indicating high crime rates and cues of mortality by placing police tape on some buildings and the floor and audio stimuli of police sirens. Furthermore, the infrastructure has come down, indicating unsustainability and dysfunction of fundamental functions and facilities such as public transport. No maintenance of public services was expressed by trash and tipped-over dumpsters laying in the streets, lack of benches and trash cans or a vandalized bus stop, and dilapidated houses (Lambie-Hanson, 2015). Such environmental cues indicate insufficient public spending on the maintenance of buildings and roads, which in turn obstructs the economic function of the area, which in turn facilitates resource scarcity (Lambie-Hanson, 2015). Additionally, an individual was sitting in a gloomy alley on a trash can between houses, seeming to be homeless. Cues of family conflict through the screaming of a fighting couple could be heard as well. The VR scene was predominantly held indifferent shades of grey and darker tones along with cloudy weather, emphasizing the mood of the scene further (Appendix B).

Contrary to the experimental VR scene, the control condition was a non-deprived neighborhood scene, more affluent. Here the infrastructure was intact. No dirt or trash could be found on the streets nor the basketball court. The sidewalk surrounding the court was equipped with multiple benches to sit on and available trash cans, indicating well-organized public spending and maintenance. The same applies to the private properties, which were intact and decorated with plants in their front yards. Bushes between the basketball court and the surrounding street were trimmed, indicating maintenance of public services. Moreover, between one of the houses, a couple was placed in the alley, calmly planning a camping trip. The sky illuminated the scene and was in shades of pink and blue with a few clouds, giving the impression of a sunset (Appendix C). Delay Discounting Task as Dependent Measure

# Discounting task
A monetary binary choice task was given to the participants on the computer via the program Open Sesame to assess behavioral patterns in delay discounting. Participants were, for example, asked, "If you had the choice, would you rather have $50 right now (SS=smaller sooner reward) or $1000 in 1 week (LL = larger later reward) from now?" (Appendix D). They had at least five decisions to make measuring their behavioral patterns regarding their preference of either smaller sooner (SS) hypothetical rewards or larger later (LL) hypothetical rewards. Each reward magnitude condition in the binary-choice task involved multiple binary monetary choices. Five delay periods (one day, one week, three month, one year, 25 years) were used to monitor choices between the two respective hypothetical rewards. Each hypothetical option was represented by two boxes, one left the larger later reward, one right the smaller sooner reward. The value for the LL reward remained the same (1000 $). The hypothetical rewards in the SS reward category increased every time the participant chooses the LL reward option from $50 to $100, $200, $300, $400, $500, $600, $700, $800, up to $900. Whenever the participant chooses the smaller sooner reward over the larger later reward, the following binary choice would start again with the SS reward being 50$ along with a new larger delay period.
