## VR Setup

The VR-environments were presented using a wireless HTC VIVE head-mounted
display (HMD). The setup provided a 110° field of view, a 90 Hz refresh rate
and a resolution of 1440 × 1600 Pixel per eye. Participants had an area of
about 6 m2 open space to navigate the virtual environment. For the execution of
the behavioral tasks and additional movement control participants held one
VR-controller in their dominant hand. The VR-software was run on a PC with the
following specifications: CPU: Intel Core i7-3600, Memory: 32.0 GB RAM,
Windows 10, GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 (Ti). The VR-environments themselves
were designed in Unity. Auditory stimuli were presented using on-ear headphones.
