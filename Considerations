Suggestions from Bruder, Scharer & Peters paper:
  The immersion in VR might have been reduced by the available physical lab space. 
  To ensure safety, the experimenter had to at times instruct participants to stay within the designated VR-zone. 
  This distraction might have reduced the effects caused by the VR-environments, 
  because participants were not able to fully ignore the actual physical surroundings. 
  Additionally, it might have influenced the EDA measurements in an unpredictable way. 
  Future research would benefit from the implementation of markers within the VR-environments in order to ensure safety without breaking immersion.
