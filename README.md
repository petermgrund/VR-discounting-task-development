# VR discounting task development project

This project uses the Unity Game engine to create VR environments within which participants will complete spatial discounting tasks. Several different environments and scenarios will be created, and our objective is to understand how discounting performance changes across different enviornments.

## Background
Temporal discounting refers to the tendency to reduce the subjective value of future goods as a function of time. In other words, it is the observation that the longer people have to wait before receiving a reward, the less they tend to value it. However, there is currently minimal research on the behavioral effects of spatial discounting. This is known as interspatial choice, wherein subjects choose between a smaller, closer reward and a larger, farther reward. In each dimension, subjects may progressively discount more temporally and spatially distant rewards (Read, McDonald, & He, 2004). Spatial discounting is believed to be distinct from other forms of discounting, although we expect it to correlate modestly with other measures of inhibition. 

## Methods
Responses to reward stimuli will be altered by the time taken to reach the reward. We may also modify the terrain, create obstacles, and reduce the visibility of the reward to understand the differential effects on discounting behavior.

## Next steps

Develop VR discounting tasks in Unity. Consider implementing the following:
- Having object farther away that users have to physically walk too
- Having the user climb to reach objects
- Working with cash assets

In order to achieve this, new assets need to be imported.

**Assets to still identify are**:

- Rewarding stimuli (i.e., money, gold, food)
- Physical obstacles (i.e., rocks, tall grass, chasms)

**New features to explore**:

- Climbing
- Border detection
- Procedural mazes
- Multiplayer

**Define broad research objectives**:

- Dollar per foot traveled
- Discounting by distance
- Discounting for physical effort
